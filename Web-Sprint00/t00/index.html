    <h2 id="h2">What makes a superhero?</h2>
    <p>
        A <b>superhero</b> is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability
        to do them in a way that a normal person couldn’t. So in order to be a
        <b>superhero</b>, you need a <b>power</b> that is more exceptional than
        any power a normal human being could possess, and you need to use that
        power to accomplish good deeds. Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman could
        be considered a superhero.<br>For instance, a good guy fighting a bad
        guy could be just a regular police story or detective story or
        human-interest story. But if it’s a good guy with a <b>superpower</b> who
        is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story. If the good guy is
        doing something that a normal human being couldn’t do, couldn’t
        accomplish, then I assume he becomes a <b>superhero</b>.

    <p>Ken Kaneki</p>
    <p>
        After an awful accident, doctors transplated Rize Kamishiro's kakuhou into
        Kaneki and transformed him into a one-eyed ghoul. That`s why he joins
        Anteiku as a part-time waiter and learns how to live as a ghoul. Now his
        goal is to make humans and ghouls finally be united together.
